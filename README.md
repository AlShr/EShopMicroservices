# EShopMicroservices

How to build Microservices on .Net platforms which used Asp.Net Web API, Docker, RabbitMQ, MassTransit, Grpc, Yarp API Gateway, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, SqlServer, Marten, Entity Framework Core, CQRS, MediatR, DDD, Vertical and Clean Architecture implementation using latest codes and best practices of .NET 8 on cloud-native environments.

You will develop e-commerce modules over Product, Basket, Discount and Ordering microservices with NoSQL (PostgreSQL DocumentDB, Redis) and Relational databases (SQLite, Sql Server) with communicating over RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication and using Yarp API Gateway. You can find Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET which step by step developing this course with extensive explanations and details.

Along with this youâ€™ll develop following microservices and items:

Catalog microservice which includes:

ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs and latest features of .NET 8 and C# 12

Vertical Slice Architecture implementation with Feature folders

CQRS implementation using MediatR library

CQRS Validation Pipeline Behaviours with MediatR and FluentValidation

Marten library for .NET Transactional Document DB on PostgreSQL

Carter library for Minimal API endpoint definition

Cross-cutting concerns Logging, global Exception Handling and Health Checks

Dockerfile and docker-compose file for running Multi-container in Docker environment
